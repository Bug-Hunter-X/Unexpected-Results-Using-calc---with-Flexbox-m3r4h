The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, leading to unexpected results. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` within a flexbox container might not produce the expected result if the parent container's size is not explicitly defined.  Another issue could arise if units are inconsistently used within the `calc()` function. For example, combining `px` and `em` without proper consideration can cause problems.
